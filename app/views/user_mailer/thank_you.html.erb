          We are a team of developers, designers, product managers and thinkers working in collaboration with the
          <a href="https://www.tarteel.ai/" target="_blank" style="color: #2ca4ab;">Tarteel</a> team to deliver the best
          online Quran reading experience.
          Alhamdulilah we have been blessed to work for some great companies around the world - and feel that this is
          the least we can do to help our Ummah move forward in learning and studying their religion.
          Working on Quran.com is very gratifying and may Allah reward us all (and reward you) for our efforts.
        </p>

        <p>
          We have a number of projects all hosted on Github. You can find them all
          <a href="https://github.com/quran" target="_blank" style="color: #2ca4ab;">here</a>. But to outline them:
        </p>


        <p>
          Typically we use
          <a href="https://github.com/quran/quran.com-frontend-next/pulls" target="_blank" style="color: #2ca4ab;">
            Github projects </a> as the source for what to work on next, what is coming up and what bugs exist that need
          to be solved.
          For example
          <a href="https://github.com/quran/quran.com-frontend-next/pulls" target="_blank" style="color: #2ca4ab;"> this
            url </a> has list of bugs, things we need help with, and upcoming features.
        </p>

        <p>
          Should you have any questions or want to contact maintainers, just write an issue. We will get back to you as
          soon as we can, inshaAllah.
        </p>
        <p>We look forward to your contribution!</p>
